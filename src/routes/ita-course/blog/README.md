# Blog App (with Markdown support)
This project was created as a part of IT-absolvent frontend ReactJS course. 
The purpose of the project was to create a simple web application that allows users to create, edit and delete blog posts.
At first, this project was created using **Local Storage** to store data, but later on I have created Backend API using **NodeJS** and **ExpressJS** to store data.
API has its own folder in this project, so you can find it in [**backend/src**](../../../../../backend/src).
- **Markdown** is used to format blog posts

### Logic
 - Whole business logic is programmed and no external library was used. It is also exported out of the component, so its available for testing.
 - **MUI**(Material UI) is used to display table
 - **Recharts** is used di display graphs
