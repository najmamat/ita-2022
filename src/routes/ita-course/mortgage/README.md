# [Mortgage Calculator App](https://matous.najman.cz/ita-course/mortgage-calculator)
This project was created as a part of IT-absolvent frontend ReactJS course. 
The purpose of the project was to create a simple web application that calculates monthly mortgage payment. 
Each of the monthly payments are displayed in a table and rendered into graphs.
- **First Graph** shows how much of monthly payment goes to monthly interest and monthly principal.
- **Second Graph** shows how much of mortgage is payed yet

### Logic
 - Whole business logic is programmed and no external library was used. It is also exported out of the component, so its available for testing.
 - **MUI**(Material UI) is used to display table
 - **Recharts** is used di display graphs
